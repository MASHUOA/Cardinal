TODO for Cardinal package
-------------------------

- Fix bugs in spatialFastmap() and spatialShrunkenCentroids()
- Test everything on PRIDE datasets and create workflow vignettes
- Write a new batchProcess() method for new classes with good defaults
- Reorganize codebase again so refactoring/debugging is easier
- Deprecate "method" arg in stats methods -> use "weights" instead
- Refactor i/o and stats methods into "CardinalIO" and "CardinalStats"
- Refactor plotting functionality to another package (?)
- Preserve sparsity when pre-processing with smooth(), etc. (?)
- MultiImagingExperiment class for multimodal experiments?
- Multimodal image registration (w/ optical images, etc.)
- Add tidy(), augment(), and glance() methods for results (?)
- A way to "compile" images for faster image loading?
